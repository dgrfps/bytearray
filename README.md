# Binaries Payload

This version is configured to make a *LINUX* payload, it doesn't make sense, ***it's purpose is understand some basics of AV bypass.***

It makes more sense to generate a *WINDOWS* payload.  

## This project has the abilities to
- Dump a program binaries.
- Generate a header with binaries-array
- Compile the array inside a new program
- Execute the generated program.

### **Sample** IS JUST A EXAMPLE, IT MIGHT BE REPLACED WITH THE DESIRED PROGRAM TO BYPASS
